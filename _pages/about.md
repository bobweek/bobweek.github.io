I apply mathematical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of biological populations. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oregon developing theory to understand the evolution of traits mediated by host-associated microbiomes. This work is jointly advised by Professors [Brendan Bohannan](https://pages.uoregon.edu/bohannanlab/), [Bill Cresko](https://wcresko.github.io/lab_website/), and [Peter Ralph](https://pages.uoregon.edu/plr/).
