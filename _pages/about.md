I apply mathematical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of biological populations. Currently, I am a [KiTE postdoctoral research fellow](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/research/early-career-researchers/kite) at Kiel University developing theory to understand the dynamics of microbiome mediated traits. In Kiel I am hosted by the [Schulenburg Group](https://evoecogen-kiel.de/) and the [Collaborative Research Center 1182](https://www.metaorganism-research.com/) focused on the study of host-microbiome systems. Additionally, I collaborate with the [Traulsen Group](https://theobio.evolbio.mpg.de/#home) at The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl√∂n, the [Bohannan Group](https://pages.uoregon.edu/bohannanlab/) at University of Oregon, and with [Dr. Aura Raulo](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/aura-raulo) at Oxford.
