## What you should be able to do after this

- Define **coevolution** precisely (and say what it is *not*)
- Explain why **ecology + space** shape coevolutionary outcomes
- Recognize how coevolution can maintain **genetic diversity**
- Contrast **antagonistic** vs **mutualistic** coevolution with case studies

Notes:
- Aim: one coherent mental model + a few anchor systems.

# Act I — What coevolution is (and is not)

## Definition (operational)

> Coevolution is reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species, driven by natural selection imposed by each on the other.

**Not coevolution:**
- one-sided adaptation
- correlated change due to shared environment
- ecological fitting / pre-adaptation without reciprocal response

Notes:
- Spend ~10–12 minutes here.
- Immediately give a “false positive” example (correlation ≠ coevolution).

---

## The phenotypic interface

The *traits that actually interact* determine:
- selection gradients
- constraints (tradeoffs, genetic architecture)
- what gets locally adapted vs not

**Key idea:** coevolution is often trait-specific, not organism-wide.

---

## Quote slide (styled callout)

> “In many cases, the strongest claim is not coevolution — it is diffuse selection or sequential adaptation.”

(Use this kind of slide to slow the tempo and reset attention.)

# Act II — Antagonistic coevolution + space

## The backbone question

Why does antagonistic coevolution so often generate:
- cycling
- escalation
- persistent polymorphism
- spatial mosaics of outcomes?

---

## Geographic mosaic (concept slide)

Coevolution is often **patchy**:

- **hotspots:** reciprocal selection is strong
- **coldspots:** interaction weak/absent or selection is one-sided
- trait distributions can be mismatched across geography

Notes:
- You can name John Thompson here without going deep.

## Image example

![](images/snake-newt.jpg)

**Snake–newt arms race** as a spatially structured system:
- local escalation in some regions
- mismatch elsewhere

Notes:
- Put 2–3 bullets only, talk over the image.

---

## Link slide (clean)

Case study reading (optional):
- Snake–newt system overview: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-skinned_newt
- Geographic mosaic theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_mosaic_theory_of_coevolution

Notes:
- Replace with primary sources later if you want.

## Host–parasite: Red Queen in one sentence

If “common” genotypes are targeted, **rarity becomes an advantage**, which can maintain diversity.

From here:
- gene-for-gene vs matching-alleles (high level)
- diversity signatures as consequences (not definitions)

---

## Two-column slide (built-in layout)

::: columns
::: column
### Gene-for-gene (idea)
- resistance and infectivity loci
- “universal” virulence often costly
- can produce balancing selection or sweeps depending on costs + ecology
:::

::: column
### Matching-alleles (idea)
- success depends on “match”
- strong frequency dependence
- often more cycling / polymorphism-friendly
:::
:::

Notes:
- Don’t formalize unless your audience is unusually pop-gen fluent.

## Local video (offline-safe)

<video src="media/fly-flower-fynbos.mp4" controls width="1000"></video>

Notes:
- Local mp4 is the most reliable in lecture halls.

Notes:
- Use this only if you trust the room Wi-Fi.

# Act III — Mutualism as constrained coevolution

## Frame shift

Antagonism: escalation / chasing  
Mutualism: **alignment under conflict**

Core problems:
- cheating / overexploitation
- partner choice, sanctions, rewards
- ecological context changes stability

---

## Example image

![](images/fly-flower.jpg)

**Fly–flower mutualisms** (or your preferred system):
- trait matching at the interface
- dependence on community/ecology
- local context can flip costs/benefits

---

## “Where this goes next” (do not expand)

- Coevolution can reshape communities (pollination networks, mutualistic webs)
- But that’s another lecture

**Take-home:** ecology + geography shape whether coevolution cycles, escalates, stabilizes, or collapses.

---

## Final slide (clean summary)

**One model to keep:**
1) coevolution is about reciprocal selection  
2) selection acts at phenotypic interfaces  
3) space fragments dynamics into mosaics  
4) antagonism maintains diversity more readily than mutualism  
5) mutualism needs constraints + ecology to persist
